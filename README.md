# Staff-attendance-system-using-RFID.
Requirements : - Arduino UNO (attached with usb wire)
               - RFID scanner and tag
               - Jumper wires
               - Breadboard
               
The Arduino acts the microcontroller where it is connected to the system and all the code is uploaded onto the board and the RFID scanner is connected using the jumper wires. Each RFID tag is registered with the details of the staff and given to them. The staffs are required to scan the RFID tag on RFID scanner which is connected to the Arduino so that their attendance is marked present on the database and it is saved.

The whole project was coded using the Visual Studio IDE.
